Hi there! Welcome to my Dijkstra Minigame Final Test Project. 

This is my first time creating a simple game in Java, utilizing Object Oriented Programming to create graphs, 
and implementing both path traversal and dijkstra algorithm to handle user input logic as well as path recording and calculations.

# How to play the minigame?
The goal in this minigame is to get from point (start) to (finish) by discovering the shortest paths for each step.
For each and every step, you have to choose one path with a shorter distance (weight) compared to the other paths in order to reach the goal.

# What happens when we find or don't find the shortest path?
If you fail to find the shortest paths, the game will give you a hint by sharing the shortest paths distance and error percentage of the paths of your choosing 
from the real shortest paths. If you manage to find the shortest paths, the minigame will congratulate you and you are going to be given the option to play again.

# What is the goal of creating this minigame?
This minigame is created for my Final Test University Project and i wish to continue improving this minigame by adding new features and proper UI for a better user experience.  

# What version is this minigame in?
This is version 0.1 or the first iteration of this minigame.
